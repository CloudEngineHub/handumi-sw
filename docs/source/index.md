# HandUMI

Collect robot-free bimanual demonstrations once with HandUMI, then validate,
retarget, and reuse them across different bimanual arms with parallel grippers.

**Core Workflows** need no robot arm: record with HandUMI, preview an
embodiment in simulation, then replay and validate the result.
**Physical Robots** covers everything that commands real hardware.

HandUMI's swappable fingertips match the robot's installed parallel-jaw
gripper, so the robot keeps its gripper. Each demonstration is stored once in
robot-agnostic form and retargeted by inverse kinematics to seven bimanual
arms. On bimanual towel folding, 562 robot-free demonstrations (111.9 min, no
robot-collected data) train policies that fold the towel on real AgileX PiPER
arms: ACT succeeds in 12/20 attempts and fine-tuned π0.5 in 7/20, while ACT
trained on the first 101 demonstrations and π0.5 without fine-tuning succeed
in none.
